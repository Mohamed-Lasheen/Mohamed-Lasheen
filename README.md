<h1 align="center"> About Me </h1>

<p align="left">
I am a fresh Computer Science graduate with honors degree from the Faculty of Computer and Information Sciences at Ain Shams University, with a GPA of 3.58. 
Specializing in creating visual reports and insightful summaries for decisions that help businesses flourish.

I have entered multiple competitions such as Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Computer Vision competitions, in which I have earned the top 3 ranks in all of them, by ensuring that the final version of the product that was delivered was as required, while also taking the extra mile to make sure that it stands out.

I used to be a Graphic Designer for a student activity, which has helped me now in creating dashboards that are aesthetically pleasing, accessible, simple and easy to read, making it effective for stakeholders to view the reports and gain the insights from them. During my time as a Graphic Designer, I was awarded Man of The Season Award for always delivering high quality designs on time.
